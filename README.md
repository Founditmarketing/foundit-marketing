# Firebase Studio

This is a NextJS starter in Firebase Studio.

To get started, take a look at src/app/page.tsx.

### Managing Teammates

To add a teammate to your project, you'll need to grant them access through the Google Cloud Console, which manages project members and permissions.

1.  **Navigate to IAM & Admin**: You can find this section in the Google Cloud Console by using the main navigation menu (☰) on the left and selecting "IAM & Admin".
2.  **Grant Access**: Click the "Grant Access" button at the top of the page.
3.  **Add Principal**: In the "New principals" field, enter your teammate's email address.
4.  **Assign Role**: Choose an appropriate role from the dropdown. For a developer who will be editing code, the **Editor** role is a good choice.
5.  **Save**: Click "Save".

Your teammate will then get an email inviting them to the project.
